## Game Instructions

Place the instructions for how to play your game in this file.  The instructions should be clear enough for any non-technical computer user to understand and follow.

1.  This game assumes that the players already know the basics of how to play chess.  If you need to see
    the rules for chess, they are available at https://www.chess.com/learn-how-to-play-chess, but even
    without knowing these rules, you can still participate.  Once a piece is selected, the available moves
    for that piece will appear.  Simply choose one of the spaces shown and your piece will move there.

2.  Enter the Player names at the prompt.  The first player will play the "white" pieces and move first and
    the second player will play the "black" pieces and play second.

3.  Using the keyboard, select one of your pieces to move by it's coordinates.  The coordinates are
    represented by the numbers on the left-hand side of the board and the letters underneath.  Enter
    the coordinates letter-first (i.e. "a1" will select the piece at the bottom left-hand corner of the board from the "white" player's perspective).

4.  A list of possible destination spaces for that piece will appear.  These possible moves follow the 
    movement rules for the selected piece.  Enter the space you would like to move the piece to.

5.  After one player's turn is complete, the game will automatically switch control to the other player who
    will then take their turn.

6.  The game will not check to see if eithe player is in check or checkmate.  It is incumbent on each
    player to inform the other if this is the case.
